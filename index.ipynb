    "# Evaluating Logistic Regression Models - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression, you are predicting continous values so it makes sense to discuss error as a distance of how far off our estimates were. When classifying a binary variable, however, a model is either correct or incorrect. As a result, we tend to quantify this in terms of how many false positives versus false negatives we come across. In particular, we examine a few different specific measurements when evaluating the performance of a classification algorithm. In this lab, you'll review precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score in order to evaluate our logistic regression models.\n",

    "At times, it may be best to tune a classification algorithm to optimize against precision or recall rather than overall accuracy. For example, imagine the scenario of predicting whether or not a patient is at risk for cancer and should be brought in for additional testing. In cases such as this, we often may want to cast a slightly wider net, and it is preferable to optimize for recall, the number of cancer positive cases, than it is to optimize precision, the percentage of our predicted cancer-risk patients who are indeed positive."
